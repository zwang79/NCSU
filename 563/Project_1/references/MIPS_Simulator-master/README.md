# MIPS_Simulator
Simulation of the pipelined MIPS architecture in C++
Simulator of the tomasulo architecture implemented in C++ - provides detailed information on every clock
cycle in the 5 stage pipeline and reports the results of an assembly program in registers and memory.

To run simulation, make then execute files in the testcases folder. Assembly code executed from .asm files in asm folder
(it is fine to write new assembly programs).
