####################################################################################
 
Reference methodology provides a set of reference scripts that serve as a good 
starting point for running a tool. These scripts are not designed to run in their 
current form. You should use them as a reference and adapt them for use in your 
design environment.

You can use the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts to run the DC Explorer 
tool for early RTL exploration and to run the Design Compiler tool for synthesis. 
The DC Explorer compatible version of the reference methodology scripts allows you 
to use the same set of scripts to run the same flow in both tools.

The Design Compiler Reference Methodology includes options for running the Synopsys 
DFT Compiler, Synopsys DFTMAX(TM), and Synopsys Power Compiler(TM) optimization 
steps. Note that additional licenses are required when you run the DFT Compiler 
tool, the DFTMAX tool, or the Power Compiler tool inside the Design Compiler or 
DC Explorer tool. The sections of the reference scripts that involve using these 
tools are marked clearly, which allows you to include or exclude these sections 
when preparing your scripts.

For the Design Compiler tool, the reference methodology provides a common set of 
scripts that you can use to run the tool in either wire load mode or topographical 
mode. This common set of reference scripts also helps you to migrate your existing 
scripts from wire load mode synthesis to topographical mode synthesis. The reference 
script detects when the tool is running in topographical mode (when you start the 
tool by entering the dc_shell command with the -topographical_mode option) and 
automatically executes additional steps related to topographical mode synthesis.

The Design Compiler Reference Methodology includes support for the following flows:

*  The top-down synthesis flow, including multivoltage synthesis with 
   IEEE 1801, which is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF)

*  The hierarchical synthesis flow, including multivoltage synthesis with UPF

*  The early RTL exploration flow, including RTL UPF exploration

   This flow requires the DC Explorer compatible version of the reference 
   methodology scripts to run the DC Explorer tool. The DC Explorer compatible 
   scripts verify the tool name and execution mode in both the DC Explorer and 
   Design Compiler tools and execute the supported steps in each tool.

*  RM+ flows:
   - High-performance low-Power (hplp)
   - High connectivity (hc)
   - Runtime Exploration (rtm_exp)

   Embed the RM+ flows in the base Design Compiler reference methodology 
   script with “if” statements to configure the relevant flows. 
   For details about the RM+ flows, see the Synopsys Design Compiler 
   Reference Methodology training slides.

The Design Compiler Reference Methodology includes Synopsys Formality(R) reference 
scripts to verify your synthesis results for all flows.

The Design Compiler Reference Methodology can also include the Synopsys MVRC 
Static Verification Reference Methodology scripts and the Synopsys Verification 
Compiler(TM) Low Power Static Signoff Reference Methodology scripts for static 
verification of multivoltage designs. These scripts are included only when you
select TRUE for the Multi-Voltage UPF option and select PRIME for the UPF Flow
option in RMgen.

Instructions:
Using the Design Compiler Reference Methodology in a Top-Down Flow
==================================================================

The file names in the following instructions refer to variable names that are 
defined in the dc_setup_filenames.tcl file. Default file names are assigned for 
all variables. You can customize your flow by changing the names to match the 
names of the files used in your flow.

This section provides instructions for the following tasks:

*  Setting up the scripts for a top-down flow
*  Running the scripts in a top-down flow

Setting Up the Scripts for a Top-Down flow
------------------------------------------

To set up the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts for a top-down flow,

1. Copy the reference methodology files to a new location.

2. Edit common_setup.tcl to set the design name, search path, and library 
   information for your design.

3. Edit dc_setup.tcl to customize your Design Compiler setup.
     
   The dc_setup.tcl file is designed to work automatically with the values 
   provided in common_setup.tcl. 
    
   o  Include a list of your RTL files in the RTL_SOURCE_FILES variable.

      Use only file names and take advantage of the search_path setting to keep
      your files portable.

      The DC Explorer and Design Compiler tools can read and determine the 
      dependencies between RTL files automatically. To use this capability, select
      AUTOREAD for the RTL Source Format option when you download the scripts from
      RMgen. You can specify a list of RTL files and RTL file directories with the 
      RTL_SOURCE_FILES variable.

      Alternatively, you can use a separate script to read the RTL files in the
      DC Explorer, Design Compiler, and Formality tools. To use this capability, 
      select SCRIPT for the RTL Source Format option when you download the scripts 
      from RMgen. The ${DCRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT} and ${FMRM_RTL_READ_SCRIPT} variables 
      in the dc_setup_filenames.tcl file define the names of these scripts.

   o  Set up multicore optimization, if desired, by using the set_host_options
      command.
       
      Ensure that you have sufficient cores and sufficient copies of all feature 
      licenses to support your settings.

   o  Specify a common alib_library_analysis_path location if you want to save 
      some runtime in subsequent DC Explorer and Design Compiler sessions.

4. Edit dc.tcl to customize the steps that you want to perform in your RTL 
   exploration and design synthesis. 
 
   Read through this script carefully, note the comments, and choose the steps 
   that you want to include in your RTL exploration and design synthesis. Remember 
   that this is a reference example and it requires modification to work with your 
   design.

   You can customize the file names for input files, output files, and reports
   by changing the file names in dc_setup_filenames.tcl.

5. Ensure that you have all of the design-specific input files that you need to 
   use in the flow.

   The tool picks up these files automatically from the search path defined in 
   common_setup.tcl. The minimum set of recommended files consists of 

   o  ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the logic design constraints

   o  ${DCRM_DCT_DEF_INPUT_FILE} or ${DCRM_DCT_FLOORPLAN_INPUT_FILE}, which 
      provides the floorplan for topographical mode synthesis

   o  ${DCRM_DFT_SIGNAL_SETUP_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the DFT signal 
      definitions

   For a complete list of expected input files, see the list at the end
   of this README file.

6. (Multivoltage flow only) Ensure that you have the additional input files 
   that you need for this flow.

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the UPF setup file

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands

   o  ${DCRM_MV_DCT_VOLTAGE_AREA_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the 
      create_voltage_area commands for topographical mode synthesis

   In the DC Explorer tool, the UPF multivoltage flow enables the exploration of
   a multivoltage power intent. This flow requires minimal UPF input, and it can 
   produce a full RTL UPF file for use in a golden UPF flow. This file contains
   additional power management inferred by the tool in an attempt to resolve
   electrical violations.

   The minimum set of recommended files for RTL UPF exploration consists of 

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the UPF setup file

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands

   The golden.upf file shows examples of UPF input files. 
   
   You can also use Visual UPF in the Synopsys Design Vision(TM) graphical user 
   interface (GUI) to generate a UPF template for your design. To open the Visual 
   UPF dialog box, choose Power > Visual UPF. For information about Visual UPF, 
   see the Power Compiler User Guide.

   For information about the golden UPF flow, see the following application note 
   on the Synopsys SolvNet(R) online support site:

   o  Golden UPF Flow

      https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/1412864.html

7. (Multicorner-multimode flow only) Ensure that you have the additional input 
   files that you need for this flow.

   The dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl setup file shows a general example of a scenario 
   setup file for a multicorner-multimode flow.

   You must have the following file:

   o  ${DCRM_MCMM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE}, which is the scenario setup file

   You also need scenario-specific versions of the following files:

   o  ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the logic design constraints

   o  ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC) 
      constraints

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands

   Scenario-specific files should use the base file name defined in
   dc_setup_filenames.tcl and should include the scenario name
   somewhere in the file name. You can configure how the scenario name
   is added to the base file name by changing the dcrm_mcmm_filename
   Tcl procedure defined in dc_setup_filenames.tcl.

   This naming style applies to both input and output files in the 
   multicorner-multimode flow.

   For the DC Explorer tool, enable the DC Explorer physical flow by setting the 
   de_enable_physical_flow variable to TRUE in the DC Explorer compatible version 
   of the dc_setup.tcl file.

Running the Scripts in a Top-Down flow
--------------------------------------

To run the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts in a top-down flow,

1. Run your RTL exploration or synthesis by using the dc.tcl script.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, run the DC Explorer or 
   Design Compiler tool from the directory above the rm_setup directory.

   o  To run the DC Explorer tool, enter the following command:

      % de_shell -f rm_dc_scripts/dc.tcl | tee dce.log

   o  To run the Design Compiler tool, enter the following command:

      % dc_shell -topographical_mode -f rm_dc_scripts/dc.tcl | tee dc.log

   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details
   

2. Verify the RTL exploration or synthesis results by looking at your log file 
   and studying the reports created in the ${REPORTS_DIR} directory.

   o  When you are satisfied that RTL exploration completed successfully, you can 
      use the database that the tool creates for the floorplan exploration flow 
      with the Synopsys IC Compiler(TM) tool.

   o  When you are satisfied that synthesis completed successfully, proceed to
      Formality verification in the next step.

3. (Synthesis flow only) Edit fm.tcl as needed for Formality verification.

4. (Synthesis multivoltage flow only) If you are mapping to retention registers, 
   replace the technology library models of those cells with Verilog simulation 
   models for Formality verification.

   For more information, see SolvNet article 024106, "Verifying UPF Designs 
   Containing Retention Registers," at 
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/024106.html.

5. (Synthesis flow only) Run your Formality verification by using the fm.tcl 
   script.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, enter the following command:

   % fm_shell -f rm_dc_scripts/fm.tcl | tee fm.log
    
   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details.
   

6. (Synthesis UPF-prime multivoltage flow only) Perform static verification of the 
   multivoltage design with the MVRC tool, by running the MVRC Static Verification 
   Reference Methodology script mvrc.tcl, or with the Verification Compiler Low
   Power Static tool, by running the Verification Compiler Low Power Static Signoff 
   Reference Methodology script vc_lp.tcl.
   
   For more information, see README.MVRC-RM.txt or README.VCLP-RM.txt.


Instructions:
Using the Design Compiler Reference Methodology in a Hierarchical Flow
======================================================================

The file names in the following instructions refer to variable names that are 
defined in the dc_setup_filenames.tcl file. Default file names are assigned for 
all variables. You can customize your flow by changing the names to match the 
names of the files used in your flow.

Note:
   The Design Compiler Reference Methodology is designed to be used together with 
   the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology, which is part of the 
   IC Compiler Reference Methodology and is available as a separate download from 
   RMgen on the SolvNet online support site.

For general hierarchical flow overview information, see the following application 
notes on the SolvNet online support site:

*  Hierarchical Flow Support in Synopsys Design Compiler Topographical Mode

   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/021034.html

*  IEEE 1801 (UPF) Hierarchical Flow Support in Synopsys Design Compiler 
   Topographical Mode and IC Compiler

   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/026172.html

This section provides instructions for the following tasks:

*  Setting up the scripts for block-level RTL exploration or synthesis in a 
*  Running the scripts for block-level RTL exploration or synthesis
*  Setting up the scripts for top-level RTL exploration or synthesis
*  Running the scripts for top-level RTL exploration or synthesis

Setting Up the Scripts for Block-Level RTL Exploration or Synthesis 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set up the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts for block-level 
RTL exploration or synthesis in a hierarchical flow,

1. Edit common_setup.tcl to set the design name, search path, and library 
   information for your design.

   Only the ${DESIGN_NAME} variable changes between your block-level synthesis 
   runs.

   Note:
      For a hierarchical flow, the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology
      requires the use of absolute paths in the common_setup.tcl file because this 
      file is used at different UNIX path locations.

      Use the ${DESIGN_REF_DATA} absolute path prefix as much as possible
      for all your search_path and library specifications in order to keep
      your common_setup.tcl file portable.

   Example:
      # Absolute path prefix variable
      set DESIGN_REF_DATA "/designs/ProjectX/Rev3/design_data"

      set ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_PATH "${DESIGN_REF_DATA}/rtl \
                                  ${DESIGN_REF_DATA}/libs"

2. Set up separate subdirectories for each hierarchical block, by using the design 
   name, and ensure that the common_setup.tcl file for each block has the 
   ${DESIGN_NAME} variable set to the block design name.

   Note:
      The IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology does this automatically.

   Even if you use the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology to set 
   up your block directories, you must copy the following files into each 
   block subdirectory:

   rm_setup/dc_setup.tcl
   rm_setup/dc_setup_filenames.tcl
   rm_dc_scripts/*

   For a SystemVerilog block design with interface ports, set the 
   SV_WRAPPER_DESIGN_NAME variable to perform the elaboration by using the
   wrapper design. For more information, see SolvNet article 039318, "Building 
   SystemVerilog Designs Using a Bottom-Up Approach," at
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/039318.html.

3. Follow the top-down flow instructions, described previously, to explore or 
   synthesize each of the hierarchical blocks by using the dc.tcl script.

4. Ensure that you have all of the design-specific input files that you need for
   each hierarchical design.

   The tool picks up these files automatically from the search path defined in 
   common_setup.tcl. 

   The minimum set of recommended files for RTL exploration consists of only the 
   ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE} file, which contains the budgeted block SDC constraints 
   from the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology.

   The minimum set of recommended files for synthesis consists of the following 
   files:

   o  ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE} contains the budgeted block SDC constraints from the 
      IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology

   o  ${DCRM_DCT_DEF_INPUT_FILE} contains the Design Exchange Format (DEF) 
      block floorplan from the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology

   o  ${DCRM_DFT_SIGNAL_SETUP_INPUT_FILE} contains the DFT signal definitions 
      for each block

   Ensure that you have DFT signal definition files for each block. This is 
   not automated in the flow. Consult with your DFT engineer to obtain the 
   correct setup for each block.

5. (Multivoltage flow only) Ensure that you have the necessary additional files  
   for each hierarchical design block.
 
   The minimum set of recommended files for synthesis consists of

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the UPF setup file for each block

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands 
      for each block

   o  ${DCRM_MV_DCT_VOLTAGE_AREA_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the 
      create_voltage_area commands for topographical mode synthesis

   In the DC Explorer tool, the UPF multivoltage flow enables the exploration of
   a multivoltage power intent. This flow requires minimal UPF input, and it can 
   produce a full RTL UPF file for use in a golden UPF flow. This file contains
   additional power management inferred by the tool in an attempt to resolve
   electrical violations.

   The minimum set of recommended files for RTL UPF exploration consists of

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the UPF setup file for each block

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands
      for each block

   The golden.upf file shows examples of UPF input files.

   You can also use Visual UPF in the Design Vision GUI to generate a UPF template 
   for your design. To open the Visual UPF dialog box, choose Power > Visual UPF. 
   For information about Visual UPF, see the Power Compiler User Guide.

   Include the create_voltage_area settings for nested power domains in
   each hierarchical design.  Get the block voltage area coordinates from
   the following IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology report:

   o  ${DESIGN_NAME}.icc_dp.voltage_area.rpt

   Make a "create_voltage_area" script file for each design with the      
   following file name: 
 
   o  ${DESIGN_NAME}.create_voltage_area.tcl

6. (Multicorner-multimode flow only) Ensure that you have the additional 
   input files that you need for each hierarchical design block.

   The dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl file shows a general example of a scenario
   setup file for a multicorner-multimode flow.

   You must have the following file:

   o  ${DCRM_MCMM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE}, which is the scenario setup file

   You also need scenario-specific versions of the following files:

   o  ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the logic design constraints
   o  ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the SDC constraints
   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage commands

   Scenario-specific files should use the base file name defined in
   dc_setup_filenames.tcl and should include the scenario name
   somewhere in the file name. You can configure how the scenario name
   is added to the base file name by changing the dcrm_mcmm_filename
   Tcl procedure defined in dc_setup_filenames.tcl.

   This naming style applies to both input and output files in the 
   multicorner-multimode flow.

   For the DC Explorer tool, enable the DC Explorer physical flow by setting the 
   de_enable_physical_flow variable to TRUE in the DC Explorer compatible version 
   of the dc_setup.tcl file.

Running the Scripts for Block-Level RTL Exploration or Synthesis
----------------------------------------------------------------

To run the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts for block-level 
RTL exploration or synthesis in a hierarchical flow,

1. Run RTL exploration or synthesis by using the dc.tcl script in each of the 
   block subdirectories.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, run the DC Explorer or 
   Design Compiler tool from the directory above the rm_setup directory.

   o  To run the DC Explorer tool, enter the following commands:

      % cd ${BLOCK_DESIGN_NAME}
      % de_shell -f rm_dc_scripts/dc.tcl | tee dce.log

   o  To run the Design Compiler tool, enter the following commands:

      % cd ${BLOCK_DESIGN_NAME} 
      % dc_shell -topographical_mode -f rm_dc_scripts/dc.tcl | tee dc.log

   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details.

2. Verify the RTL exploration or synthesis results by looking at your log file and 
   studying the reports created in the ${REPORTS_DIR} directory.

   o  When you are satisfied that RTL exploration completed successfully, you can 
      use the database that the tool creates for the floorplan exploration flow 
      with the IC Compiler tool.

   o  When you are satisfied that synthesis completed successfully, proceed to
      Formality verification in the next step.

3. (Synthesis flow only) Edit fm.tcl as needed for Formality verification.

4. (Synthesis multivoltage flow only) If you are mapping to retention registers, 
   replace the technology library models of those cells with Verilog simulation 
   models for Formality verification.

   For more information, see SolvNet article 024106, "Verifying UPF Designs 
   Containing Retention Registers," at 
   https://solvnet.synopsys.com/retrieve/024106.html. 

5. (Synthesis flow only) Verify each block synthesis run separately by running the 
   Formality tool with the fm.tcl script.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, enter the following command:

   % cd ${BLOCK_DESIGN_NAME} 
   % fm_shell -topographical_mode -f rm_dc_scripts/fm.tcl | tee fm.log

   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details.

6. Verify that all of your block-level runs have been completed successfully.


Setting Up the Scripts for Top-Level RTL Exploration or Synthesis
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To set up the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts for top-level 
RTL exploration or synthesis in a hierarchical flow,

1. Create an additional subdirectory for your top-level synthesis.

   Note that the IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology does this 
   automatically.

2. Edit common_setup.tcl at the top-level.

   o  Include the list of hierarchical design names and cell names in the
      common_setup.tcl variables shown in the following example:

      #############################################################################
      # Hierarchical Flow Design Variables
      #############################################################################

      set HIERARCHICAL_DESIGNS    "" ;# List of hierarchical block design names 
                                        "DesignA DesignB" ...
      set HIERARCHICAL_CELLS      "" ;# List of hierarchical block cell instance 
                                        names "u_DesignA u_DesignB" ...

   o  Add any IC Compiler block abstractions to the ${MW_REFERENCE_LIB_DIRS} 
      variable.

      Specify the Synopsys Milkyway(TM) design library that contains the block 
      abstraction for the abstracted block.

3. Define the hierarchical block design names in the dc_setup.tcl file:

   o  DDC_HIER_DESIGNS -- list of Synopsys logical database format (.ddc) 
      hierarchical design names

   o  ICC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS -- list of IC Compiler block abstraction
      design names

   o  DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS  -- list of Design Compiler block abstraction 
      hierarchical designs without transparent interface optimization

   o  DC_BLOCK_ABSTRACTION_DESIGNS_TIO --  list of Design Compiler block 
      abstraction hierarchical designs with transparent interface optimization

4. Ensure that you have all of the design-specific input files that you need 
   to use in the flow.
 
   The tool picks up these files automatically from the search path defined in 
   common_setup.tcl. The minimum set of recommended files consists of 

   o  ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the logic design constraints

   o  ${DCRM_DCT_DEF_INPUT_FILE} or ${DCRM_DCT_FLOORPLAN_INPUT_FILE}, which 
      provides the floorplan to use for topographical mode synthesis

   o  ${DCRM_DFT_SIGNAL_SETUP_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the DFT signal 
      definitions

   Use the same constraints for top-level RTL exploration or synthesis that you 
   would use for a top-down flow.

   o  For topographical mode synthesis, include the floorplan for the top-level
      design.

   o  Use a floorplan where the hierarchical blocks have been partitioned and
      have fixed placement at the top-level.

      The IC Compiler Hierarchical Reference Methodology creates an updated 
      top-level floorplan with fixed placement information for the hierarchical 
      blocks.

   A complete list of the expected input files is provided at the end of this 
   README file.

5. (Multivoltage flow only) Ensure that you have the additional files that you 
   need for this flow. 

   The minimum set of recommended files for synthesis consists of

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the top-level UPF setup file

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the top-level 
      set_voltage commands

   o  ${DCRM_MV_DCT_VOLTAGE_AREA_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the 
      create_voltage_area commands for topographical mode synthesis

   In DC Explorer tool, the UPF multivoltage flow enables the exploration of
   a multivoltage power intent. This flow requires minimal UPF input, and it can 
   produce a full RTL UPF file for use in a golden UPF flow. This file contains
   additional power management inferred by the tool in an attempt to resolve
   electrical violations.

   The minimum set of recommended files for RTL UPF exploration consists of

   o  ${DCRM_MV_UPF_INPUT_FILE}, which is the top-level UPF setup file

   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the top-level
      set_voltage commands

   Note:
      The UPF file for top-level synthesis should include UPF design information 
      for the top-level design only. Block-level UPF information is propagated to 
      the top-level design as a part of the flow.

   You can also use Visual UPF in the Design Vision GUI to generate a UPF template 
   for your design. To open the Visual UPF dialog box, choose Power > Visual UPF. 
   For information about Visual UPF, see the Power Compiler User Guide.

6. (Multicorner-multimode flow only) Ensure that you have the input files that 
   you need for this flow.

   The dc.mcmm.scenarios.tcl file shows a general example of a scenario
   setup file for a multicorner-multimode flow in the Design Compiler tool.
 
   You must have the following file:

   o  ${DCRM_MCMM_SCENARIOS_SETUP_FILE}, which is the scenario setup file

   You also need scenario-specific versions of the following files:

   o  ${DCRM_CONSTRAINTS_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the logic design constraints
   o  ${DCRM_SDC_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the SDC constraints
   o  ${DCRM_MV_SET_VOLTAGE_INPUT_FILE}, which provides the set_voltage_commands

   Scenario-specific files should use the base file name defined in
   dc_setup_filenames.tcl and should include the scenario name
   somewhere in the file name. You can configure how the scenario name
   is added to the base file name by changing the dcrm_mcmm_filename
   Tcl procedure defined in dc_setup_filenames.tcl.

   This naming style applies to both input and output files in the 
   multicorner-multimode flow.

   For the DC Explorer tool, enable the DC Explorer physical flow by setting
   de_enable_physical_flow variable to TRUE in the DC Explorer  compatible version 
   of the dc_setup.tcl file.

7. For a SystemVerilog design with interface ports, uncomment the 
   link_portname_allow_period_to_match_underscore variable setting in dc_top.tcl.
   
   This variable enables the linker to allow a period (.) as an alternative to an 
   underscore (_) during port name matching.

Running the Scripts for Top-Level RTL Exploration or Synthesis
--------------------------------------------------------------

To run the Design Compiler Reference Methodology scripts for top-level 
RTL exploration or synthesis in a hierarchical flow,

1. Run RTL exploration or synthesis at the top level by using the dc_top.tcl 
   script.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, run the DC Explorer or 
   Design Compiler tool from the directory above the rm_setup directory.

   o  To run the DC Explorer tool, enter the following commands:

      % cd ${TOP_DESIGN_NAME}
      % de_shell -f rm_dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl | tee dce_top.log

   o  To run the Design Compiler tool, enter the following commands:

      % cd ${TOP_DESIGN_NAME} 
      % dc_shell -topographical_mode -f rm_dc_scripts/dc_top.tcl | tee dc_top.log

   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details.

2. Verify the RTL exploration or synthesis results by looking at your log file and 
   studying the reports created in the ${REPORTS_DIR} directory.

   o  When you are satisfied that RTL exploration completed successfully, use the 
      database that the tool creates for the floorplan exploration flow with the 
      IC Compiler tool.

   o  When you are satisfied that synthesis completed successfully, proceed to
      Formality verification in the next step.

3. (Synthesis flow only) Edit fm_top.tcl as needed for Formality verification.

4. (Synthesis flow only) Verify your top-level synthesis by using the Formality 
   tool with the fm_top.tcl script.

   For the standard reference methodology flow, enter the following command:

   % cd ${TOP_DESIGN_NAME} 
   % fm_shell -topographical_mode -f rm_dc_scripts/fm_top.tcl | tee fm_top.log

   This RM can optionally be run directly in Lynx.See ./rm_in_lynx/README.running_RM_in_Lynx_RTM.txt for more    details. 

5. (Synthesis UPF-prime multivoltage flow only) Perform static verification of the 
   full chip multivoltage design with the MVRC tool, by using the MVRC Static 
   Verification Reference Methodology script mvrc_top.tcl, or with the Verification 
   Compiler Low Power Static tool, by running the Verification Compiler Low Power 
   Static Signoff Reference Methodology script vc_lp_top.tcl.

   For more information, see README.MVRC-RM.txt or README.VCLP-RM.txt.

The final written netlist contains the design without the physical hierarchical
blocks. The next tool in the flow is expected to read the physical block-level 
synthesis results in addition to the top-level synthesis results to obtain the 
complete synthesized design.

Output Files from the Design Compiler Reference Methodology
===========================================================

The ${REPORTS_DIR} directory defined in dc_setup.tcl contains reports from the 
RTL exploration or synthesis run.

The ${RESULTS_DIR} directory defined in dc_setup.tcl contains the RTL exploration 
or synthesis output files, including the mapped netlist and the files needed for 
timing analysis, power analysis, and formal verification.

You can see the complete list of output files and define the file names in 
the dc_setup_filenames.tcl file.

The output files generated by the Design Compiler Reference Methodology 
scripts are designed to be used as inputs for the IC Compiler Reference 
Methodology.  The IC Compiler Reference Methodology is the next step in the 
reference flow and is available as a separate download from RMgen on the SolvNet 
online support site.
